Feature: Register and Activate user
    As a user, I want to sign up on the web platform

    Scenario: A person registers on the app and tries to activate their user
        When The user "student1" with email "student1@iw.uca.es" and password "password" registers on the app
        And The user "student1" introduces their email "student1@iw.uca.es" and a verification code to activate
            Then The user gets a message with the text "Felicidades. El usuario ha sido activado"

    Scenario: A non-registered person tries to activate their user
        When The user "student2" introduces their email "student2@iw.uca.es" and a verification code to activate
        Then The user gets a message with the text "Ups. No se ha podido activar el usuario"
